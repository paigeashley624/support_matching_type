# Support Matching Type

This match_users.eb file resolved conflicts in a single CSV file by identifying duplicate emails and/or phone numbers using a predefined priority list.

## What It Does

- Reads a single input CSV file (e.g., `input1.csv`)
- Outputs a cleaned-up version (e.g., `input1_output.csv`) with only one row per unique ID

## File Structure

- `inputX.csv` â†’ your original data
- `inputX_output.csv` â†’ cleaned and de-duplicated version
